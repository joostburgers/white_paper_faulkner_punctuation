As the calculations for this project were quite involved, they have been separated into three different documents.\n\nText processing: This shows the standard pre-cleaning done before any textual analysis.\nOutlier Detection: This covers the calculations done to detect outliers in punctuation-mark usage in all of Faulkner’s fictions.\nSentence and Demographic Correlation: Shows the process of creating a demographic database and also running Pearson correlations between different variables.\n\nIn all cases, some raw data has been witheld. In particular this pertains to digitized copies of Faulkner’s texts, the posting of which would violate copyright. Secondarily, the demographic data extracted from the Digital Yoknapatawpha database has also been masked, even if the results are available. This data belongs to all the scholars who worked so hard to create it, and I do not have singular authority to distribute it to anyone without their consent. We are happy to release the data for scholarly purposes."
